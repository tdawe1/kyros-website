## 🤔 Why Astro?

This project was built using **Astro** as a learning experience and exploration of modern web development tools. As my first time using Astro, I chose it for several compelling reasons:

- **Performance First**: Astro's "zero JavaScript by default" approach ensures lightning-fast page loads
- **Component Islands**: The ability to selectively add interactivity only where needed
- **Framework Agnostic**: Can use React, Vue, Svelte components alongside vanilla HTML/CSS
- **Static Site Generation**: Perfect for content-heavy websites that don't need complex client-side state
- **Modern Developer Experience**: Built-in TypeScript support, hot reloading, and excellent tooling
- **Learning Opportunity**: A chance to explore a framework that's gaining significant traction in the static site space

**Note**: This is my first Astro project, so the codebase represents a learning journey. It may not follow all Astro best practices yet.
