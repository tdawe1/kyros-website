### **Project Brief for Website**

**Project Title:** Single-Page Marketing Website

**1. Project Overview & Goal**

We need a professional, modern, and highly credible single-page marketing website for our new B2B consultancy.

The primary goal of this website is to **generate qualified leads** by clearly communicating our value proposition to UK-based small and mid-sized businesses (SMEs) and compelling them to book our initial "Discovery Sprint" service.

**2. Brand Identity & Core Message**

We are a specialist consultancy that builds bespoke, lightweight automation and AI tools for SMEs.

*   **Our Core Message:** We are the competent, hands-on builders who solve the real-world workflow problems you're too busy to fix. We cut through the hype and deliver practical tools that provide a measurable return on investment.
*   **Our Tone:** The tone should be a sophisticated blend of two things:
    *   **Assertive & Competent:** Like our competitors, we need to sound like authoritative experts. Our language should be direct, confident, and outcome-focused.
    *   **Empathetic & Grounded:** Unlike our competitors, our unique selling proposition is a deep understanding of what SMEs *actually* want. Our copy avoids corporate jargon and enterprise-level complexity, speaking directly to the daily pain points of a business owner.
*   **Brand Keywords:** Practical, Bespoke, Competent, Authoritative, Empathetic, Efficient, ROI-Focused.

**3. Target Audience**

Our client is the owner or senior manager of a UK-based SME (typically 5-50 employees).

*   **Their Mindset:** They are pragmatic, time-poor, and highly results-oriented. They are experts in their own field but are not tech experts.
*   **Their Pain Points:** They are acutely aware of "busywork" in their business—manual reporting, repetitive admin, clunky sales processes—and know it's costing them time and money.
*   **What They Want:** Tangible ROI, no jargon, and lightweight, practical fixes that don't require a complex enterprise system or a long, disruptive rollout.
*   **What They Are Skeptical Of:** Over-hyped AI promises, expensive consultants, and bloated software that isn't tailored to their specific needs.

**4. Design & Visual Direction**

We have a clear visual direction based on a "Minimalist Monochrome + Accent" scheme.

*   **Aesthetic:** Sharp, professional, modern, clean, and uncluttered. The design should feel competent and efficient, just like our tools.
*   **Primary Color Palette:**
    *   **Backgrounds:** Clean White (`#FFFFFF`) or a very soft Gray (`#F8F9FA`).
    *   **Primary Text:** Dark Charcoal Gray (`#212529`).
    *   **Headlines:** Solid Black (`#000000`).
*   **Accent Color:**
    *   **Electric Blue (`#007BFF`):** This should be used **sparingly but deliberately** for all primary calls-to-action (buttons, links) and to highlight key, quantifiable metrics in the case studies (e.g., "10+ hours," "70%").
*   **Typography:** Please use a clean, modern, and highly legible sans-serif font family like **Inter, Lato, or similar.** Strong, clear typography and a confident use of whitespace are critical to achieving this look.

**5. Website Structure, Wireframe, and Final Copy**

The website will be a single page with the following sections, in this order. 
Use this placeholder copy as an indicator of tone.

1. Hero Section

Headline:
Automation without the bloat. ROI without the gamble.

Subheadline:
We help UK SMEs cut bottlenecks, save hours, and unlock growth with lightweight, bespoke automation — built in weeks, not years. No jargon, no lock-in, no wasted spend.

CTA Buttons:
[ Book Your Free Discovery Call ]
[ See Real Results ]

2. 

Section Headline:
Clarity. Speed. Control.

Copy:
Most automation agencies push complexity. We do the opposite - practical, no-nonsense tools that slot into your workflows, pay for themselves fast, and leave your team in control.

ROI First: If it doesn’t save money or time, we don’t build it.

Lightweight, No Bloat: Bespoke tools designed to fit your exact process, not the other way around.

Enablement, Not Dependency: Clear guides and playbooks so your team can run with confidence — no vendor lock-in.

Risk-Free Discovery: Our Discovery Sprint identifies ROI opportunities. If we don’t find any, you don’t pay.

3. Our 3-Step Path to ROI

Section Headline:
From bottleneck to business win in 4–8 weeks.

Copy:
We’ve productized our approach so you always know where you stand.

Discovery Sprint (1–2 Weeks)
We map your workflows and pinpoint the 3–5 highest-ROI fixes. If we don’t find opportunities worth pursuing, you pay nothing.

Pilot Build (2–4 Weeks)
We design and deploy your first automation — tackling the most painful bottleneck head-on. From day one, it delivers measurable savings.

Implementation & Enablement
We roll out additional solutions, provide your team with simple guides, and stay on hand for refinement — ensuring long-term ROI.

4. Case Studies (Real-World Results)

**6. Key Functionality**

*   The website must be **fully responsive** and provide an excellent experience on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile-first).
*   The CTA buttons should link to a **scheduling tool** (e.g., Calendly) for booking the Discovery Sprint.
*   The site should be **fast-loading** and built with SEO best practices in mind (e.g., proper use of H1/H2 tags, meta descriptions).

**7. Inspiration & Competitors**

Please review the following companies to understand the visual language of our niche:
*   **Luhhu.com:** We like their clean, minimalist aesthetic and the confident use of a single, bright accent color.
*   **Momentum.io:** We admire their premium, sophisticated dark-mode feel and creative branding.

Our goal is to be in this class of professionalism but with our own unique, empathetic voice and minimalist blue-accented aesthetic.

**8. Deliverables**

The final deliverable is a fully developed and tested single-page website, live on our chosen domain.
